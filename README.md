# SPEED-FIRMWARE
ive been creating firmware sets for high speed 3d printing since 2022.I feel that its time to release them now more then ever since a post i put on creality was taken and i was given absolutely no credit for it for the v3se firmware so i will now release multiple sets specific to multiple machines and configurations PLEASE ENJOY 

PLEASE MATCH CONFIGURATION.H types to their CONFIGURATION_ADV TYPES AND SIMPLY COPY AND PASTE THE CODING INTO YOUR MARLIN 2.1.2.1 VERSION

MORE TO COME :)
