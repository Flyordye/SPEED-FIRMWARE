# SPEED-FIRMWARE
ive been creating firmware sets for high speed 3d printing since 2022.I feel that its time to release them now more then ever since a post i put on creality was taken and i was given absolutely no credit for it for the v3se firmware so i will now release multiple sets specific to multiple machines and configurations PLEASE ENJOY 

PLEASE MATCH CONFIGURATION.H types to their CONFIGURATION_ADV TYPES AND SIMPLY COPY AND PASTE THE CODING INTO YOUR MARLIN 2.1.2.1 VERSION

MORE TO COME :)

special thanks goes to : FORMERLURKER (arcwelder)
special thanks goes to : Colin godsey (direct stepping)
special thanks goes to : Tombrazier (input shaping)
(thank you to the team who created linear advance in marlin)
(special thanks to Paul Paukstelis for Průša Slicer and Aapo Saaristo for Cura to allow M486 commands to cancel objects) 

TRULY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU :)


all i did was compile it and make functions work all together as a whole 
while errors appeared i focused on getting everything together to be just like klipper
this firmware can be octoprint compatible so if you do want camera or wifi it works :)
